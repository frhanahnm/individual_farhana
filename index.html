		<div class="w3-container">
			<p>I was born on 11th of January as the second daughter of four siblings. Being raised up as one of the big sisters at home, challenges me to be matured at a very young age. Not only I get to learn doing house chores, I also learnt how to take care of my younger siblings as my parents were busy for work. It most likely looked like I was always in charge at home. As I growing up, I have always been observing people’s emotions. It’s a thing I always do subconsciously, really. The most common emotions that not everyone get to do is loving oneself. Loving ourselves.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="w3-container">
		<p>I am a big fan of music. In my way, music could be an escaping place for me to run away from the noisy real life and just focus on one thing. Listening to music that was often played during a significant life event, such as a family celebration, or perhaps a breakup may leave some prints. It can trigger a deeply nostalgic emotional experience, and a musical scar. The feeling is not the music but the experience it reminds us of.</p>

		<h3><b>DREAM</b></h3>
		<h5>CHILDHOOD DREAMS, <span class="w3-opacity">June 1st, 2020</span></h5>
	</div>

	<div class="w3-container">
		<p>Growing up, I sure have a lot of dreams during my childhood. For me dreaming can be an escapism that creates a whole new world for you to wander. Dreaming involves holding tight to a vision of a better life, one of success and abundance. Dreaming can also makes your brain works about wandering something and thinking about something.</p>

		<h5>FAVORITE EXPERIENCE WITH FAMILY, <span class="w3-opacity">June 1st, 2020</span></h5>
	</div>

	<div class="w3-container">
		<p>Talking topic about favorite experiences with family is one of the most exciting thing to do since reminiscing good times is a good thing to do. It makes you realize there are a lot of things to be grateful for in this world, and being with family is one of them. I do have a lot of experiences that makes me feel very much alive and happy with my family. But there are some that really sticks in my heart and memory and those would be things that I would tell my future children.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="w3-container">
		<p>Entertainment is something we love, right? My type of entertainment is mostly watching random things on Netflix or watching any mysterious-crime-discussion kind of videos on Youtube. Or even sticking to one specific show to drown me into the world of another story. I enjoy a lot of genres of shows, be it Korean dramas or Chinese dramas, investigation shows or even watching Japanese animation series, or anime.</p>
