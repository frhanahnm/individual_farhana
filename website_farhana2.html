  <div class="w3-container">
    <p>Growing up, I sure have a lot of dreams during my childhood. For me dreaming can be an escapism that creates a whole new world for you to wander. Dreaming involves holding tight to a vision of a better life, one of success and abundance. Dreaming can also makes your brain works about wandering something and thinking about something. In my vision, I don't think dreaming is something bad or out-of-date or uncool. That is why, when I was a kid, I always dreamed of becoming a doctor for animals, a veterinarian. I LOVE animals so much. All kinds of animals are dear to me so when I told my parents that I wanted to be someone who can help animals that are sick they immediately said, "Be a vet!". That was why, I always watch every kind of shows that had vets on it, like the ones on the National Geographic, I thought they were the coolest people ever.</p>

    <p>Then, came the 10-year-old me who suddenly thought that, "People who work and investigate things about planets and stars are so cool!". The thought came when I was in a car one night and just stared at the night sky that was full of stars! It really looked like the whole universe was right in front of my eyes. Then I told my parents, "Isn't it cool to actually have a job where you look up the sky and just get to know all about stars? Hanging out and talk about the new planets being discovered?". My parents suddenly laughed and said, "Now you are talking of becoming an astronomer? We thought you wanted to be a vet." Yeah, I just changed my mind that night. So the next morning, I went to my school's library and read a ton of books about planets and stars. Science also been my favorite subject since that day. Then, that dream kind of sticked to me until I was 15 years old. When I turned 16, I suddenly felt like dreams don't usually come true like how we thought it would be. The works and dedications I should have put on to make my dreams come true were not enough. Being an astronomer or a veterinarian is not an easy thing to do. As of right now, I don't really have any specific dream or mission that I want to accomplish and make it work. I just go with the flow for this phase and learn different things that I wouldn't expect I would be doing.</p>

    <p>So those are some of the dreams that I had when I was a kid and those dreams are very much clear to my memories as they were really things that I put a lot of thoughts on. Just like what the Interent says, "You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream".</p>
