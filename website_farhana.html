		<p>I was born on 11th of January as the second daughter of four siblings. Being raised up as one of the big sisters at home, challenges me to be matured at a very young age. Not only I get to learn doing house chores, I also learnt how to take care of my younger siblings as my parents were busy for work. It most likely looked like I was always in charge at home. As I growing up, I have always been observing people’s emotions. It’s a thing I always do subconsciously, really. The most common emotions that not everyone get to do is loving oneself. Loving ourselves. In my opinion, it is really vital to have an affectionate emotions towards ourselves as people, as human beings because loving ourselves is the first step towards love itself. You cannot really get to love anyone else before be loving to your own self. Be thankful, be grateful, be appreciative and go easy on yourself. When you make decisions out of guilt, a need to please or to avoid conflict, you overvalue the needs of others and disrespect yourself. This conveys—to yourself and those around you—that you accept very little. That doesn’t feel very good, does it? Some people equate self-love with selfishness. But that’s not true. When you think this way, it becomes hard to take good care of yourself. Delete that limiting belief from your mind. Create a new belief that echoes in your ear: “It’s okay to put my needs first.” The good news is when you love yourself fully you feed your soul and become the highest version of yourself.Take time to appreciate yourself. Congratulate yourself on a job well done. Have a great meal, go do something fun. Once you find your sense of self and become more self-aware and develop true self-love, opportunities will present themselves.</p>
