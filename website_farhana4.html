    <h3><b>SHOWS</b></h3>
    <h5>FAVORITE SHOWS TO WATCH, <span class="w3-opacity">June 1st, 2020</span></h5>
  </div>

  <div class="w3-container">
    <p>Entertainment is something we love, right? My type of entertainment is mostly watching random things on Netflix or watching any mysterious-crime-discussion kind of videos on Youtube. Or even sticking to one specific show to drown me into the world of another story. I enjoy a lot of genres of shows, be it Korean dramas or Chinese dramas, investigation shows or even watching Japanese animation series, or anime.</p>

    <p>I think my favorite show is Crash Landing on You which is a popular Korean drama. This show tells about the story and relatioonship between a woman from South Korea and a man from North Korea. This show instantly becomes my favorite because the chemistry between the casts and the plot of the whole show. Overall, it is a very heartwarming story since it really trying to potray the beauty of unision of the South Korean woman with people from the North Korea. Even though with things that are happening right now between the two countries, it really gives the people of their nation of the hope that they would become one nation again. It is a really beautiful story that made bawling for the most part of the whole show.</p>

    <div class="w3-container">
  <p>This is <a href="https://www.netflix.com/my/title/81159258">the link</a> for the show. It is totally worth watching it if you love rom-com kind of show with a twist of melancholy stories in it.</p>
