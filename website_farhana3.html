    <h5>FAVORITE EXPERIENCE WITH FAMILIY, <span class="w3-opacity">June 1st, 2020</span></h5>

  <div class="w3-container">
    <p>Talking topic about favorite experiences with family is one of the most exciting thing to do since reminiscing good times is a good thing to do. It makes you realize there are a lot of things to be grateful for in this world, and being with family is one of them. I do have a lot of experiences that makes me feel very much alive and happy with my family. But there are some that really sticks in my heart and memory and those would be things that I would tell my future children.</p>

    <p>My most favorite experience is travelling. I do a lot of travellings with faimly, of course. Road trips are the best! It just gives me this travelling vibe while driving on the road for hours. It may sound very much tiring but it's a good experience! If people ever ask me which one do I prefer, travelling by planes or road trips, I would go for the later one. My mother's hometown is about 557km to the north from where I'm currently living in. When going to my mother's honmetown, my father is pretty much comfortable driving during nights rather than during the day. He said there are not that lots of cars on the road during the nights so he always prefer starting our driving on 8pm. As for me, night road trips are amazing because I can see all the citylights and just watching the starry skies makes me happy. The 6 hours of drive surely is tiring for anyone else as well, so it's not an exception for our family. While keeping my father accompanied as he drives, my siblings and me would always make a new topic for a conversation so my father would not be bored. The topics from geographical issues to soulmates issues sure keeping us all awake during the drive. I find it very amusing and relaxing that during those 6 hours of drive, we all connected as a faimly even closer though the conversations in the car.</p>
