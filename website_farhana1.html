    <h3><b>MUSIC</b></h3>

    <p>I am a big fan of music. In my way, music could be an escaping place for me to run away from the noisy real life and just focus on one thing. Listening to music that was often played during a significant life event, such as a family celebration, or perhaps a breakup may leave some prints. It can trigger a deeply nostalgic emotional experience, and a musical scar. The feeling is not the music but the experience it reminds us of. Music also becomes my other language that speaks about my emotions. When I often hear "actions speak louder than words", I think to myself that sometimes music can speak louder than anything. Music is definitely a language of emotion in that it can represent different feelings and barge into the soul with no boundaries or limitations.</p> 

    <p>One of my favorite songs that touch the topic of self love is Epiphany by the Korean boyband, BTS. Epiphany gives a meaning of a moment of sudden and great realization or revelation. In the song, it mainly starts with the theme of how we sometimes get carried away when we are in love, where the lyrics say: "I for sure loved you so much. Adapted to you with everything. I wanted to live my life for you." But after a period of time, we have to face the reality of who we really are and  what we really feel as the lyrics pointed out: "But as I keep doing that I just can't bear the storm inside my heart. The real me behind the smiling mask. I reveal it entirely." Although the journey of learning and loving yourself can be scary and uncertain, it is not impossible. It is one of the bravest steps anyone can ever take. In this song, the singers realises that he deserves to love himself instead of allowing himself to be swept away by others. He reminds us that we too deserve the love we show to other. The most touching part of the song for me is when it hits the chorus where the lyrics said: "I'm the one I should love. The shining me, precious soul of mine. I finally realized so I love me. Not so perfect but so beautiful." This specific song has a very special place in my heart that it gives me hopes about self love is really important and very beautiful.</p>
